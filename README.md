## Rewrite History

### Description

Allow users to rename an item in REDCap including rewriting the history of the item similar to a 'git mv'.

We currently cover the following REDCap locations that potentially contain references to items:
- instruments (element names, branching logic, tags, notes)
- reports
- logs

TODO:
- update snapshot of instruments
- complex piping with chained :value, :checked, :unchecked, (code)
