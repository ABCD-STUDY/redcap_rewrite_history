## Rewrite History

### Description

Allow users to rename an item in REDCap including rewriting the history of the item similar to a 'git mv'.

We cover the following REDCap elements:
- instruments (element names and branching logic)
- reports
- logs

TODO:
- edit the snapshots of instruments
- complex piping with :value, :checked, :unchecked, (code). These items can be chained!
